<h3>About</h3>
<div>
<p> I'm a researcher at <a href="https://research.nianticlabs.com/">Niantic's AR Research</a> team led by <a href=http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/G.Brostow/>Gabriel Brostow</a> and based in London, UK. Previously, I spent a couple of years as a postdoc at <a href='https://imperial.ac.uk/'>Imperial College London</a> in collaboration with <a href=https://research.samsung.com/>Samsung Research</a>. I completed my Ph.D. in computer vision and machine learning in 2017 supervised by <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/tkkim/home'>Tae-Kyun Kim</a> also at Imperial. In a previous life, I was in Paris (<a href='https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home'>MSc./Diplôme d'Ingénieur at Télécom Paris</a>) and in Barcelona (BSc. at <a href='https://www.upc.edu/en?set_language=en'>Technical University of Catalonia - UPC</a>).</p>
<p>I particularly enjoy teaching, supervising students and disseminating research to audiences of different backgrounds and ages. I've been involved in the organization of academic events such as <a href="https://bmvc2017.london">BMVC 2017</a>, different workshops at <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/hands2019/'>CVPR, ICCV and ECCV</a> conferences and also had the chance of teaching at the <a href='https://nepalschool.naamii.com.np/'>Nepal Winter School in AI 2018</a>.</p>
